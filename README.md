# meet app
## Objective
To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. 
The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events for a selected city.
## Context
Serverless and PWAs have grown in popularity over the last few years, and they’re both considered to be the future of web development. By combining these two concepts, your app will not only work as a normal web application, but it will also reap the benefits of both serverless architecture and PWAs:
- Serverless:​ No backend maintenance, easy to scale, always available, no cost for idle time.
- PWAs:​ Instant loading, offline support, push notifications, “add to home screen” prompt, responsive design, and cross-platform compatibility.

For this app, you’ll be using a TDD approach, where you write tests before writing the actual functionality for your app in code. Writing tests forces you to focus on the requirements of your application before jumping into the code. TDD relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle, allowing you to get immediate feedback and deliver high-quality code.
Last but not least, you’ll add some graphs to your app, which will make it more visually appealing and allow you to more easily draw conclusions from the data. A picture is worth a thousand words, right? With a number of visualization techniques under your belt, you’ll be able to display any type of data you want and produce a variety of output formats. Your app will allow users to search for a city and get a list of meetup events hosted in that city. For the data visualization component, you’ll add a chart that shows how many events (meetups) will take place in that city on upcoming days.
